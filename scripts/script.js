  /* assuming we have 4 different slides
        we can index these slides as follows:
        Slide 1 = 0
        Slide 2 = 1
        Slide 3 = 2
        Slide 4 = 3

        Now, we set the current slide index to be zero.

        currentSlide = 0

        Now, we need to find a way to increment the currentSlide index 
        every 2.1 seconds as specified in our setInterval method.

        recall the slide.length = 4
        This tells us that the index stops at 3.

        currentSlide = 0 + 4/4 = 1 [new currentSlide]

        now that the currentSlide is 1, when the setInterval runs 
        it again, we have:

        currentSlide = 1 + 4/4 = 2 [new currentSlide]

        now that the currentSlide is 2, when the setInterval runs 
        it again, we have:

        currentSlide = 2 + 4/4 = 3 [new currentSlide]

        since our index stops at 3. The setInternal starts from the
        beginning again by assigning 0 to currentSlide and doing same 
        process all over again.
